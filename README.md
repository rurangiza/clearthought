# What is Clear Thought?

Clear-thought is a tool to help pisciners better identify their errors after a correction by the Moulinette.

After every correction, we receive a "trace", which is an email showing us what tests were performed on our code. This email can guide us to understand what went wrong and how to improve our code. Unfortunatly, the way it's formated makes it difficult to seperate useful informations from boring details. So most students don't bother with it.

So my goal with this project, is to make those computer generated emails, human readable. I will do so by removing non critical informations and creating visual hierarchy for better readability.
